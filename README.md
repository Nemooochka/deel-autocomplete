## Hi Deel Team,

### I've created two version of Autocomplete:
1. Autocomplete with real API fetching data on each keystroke.
2. Autocomplete with real API fetching data once on loading.

### How to run a project:
* You should have Node.js v.18+
1. Run 'npm i' in the root folder
2. Run 'npm run dev' in the root folder
