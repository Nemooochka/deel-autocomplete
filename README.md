## Hi Deel Team,

### There are two versions of Autocomplete:
1. `Real-time API Autocomplete`: Fetches data from the API with each keystroke.
2. `Initial Load API Autocomplete`: Fetches all data from the API once during the initial load.

### To run the project:
* Ensure you have Node.js v18 or higher.
1. Navigate to the root folder and run `npm i` to install dependencies.
2. Then, execute `npm run dev` to start the development server.
